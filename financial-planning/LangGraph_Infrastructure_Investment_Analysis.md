## Implementation Timeline
- **Month 1:** ₹3,50,000 - Infrastructure setup & training initiation
- **Month 2-3:** ₹1,50,000/month - Core development & testing
- **Month 4:** ₹2,00,000 - Production preparation
- **Month 5-6:** ₹1,75,000/month - Deployment & optimization

## Business Justification
**Current System Costs:** ₹8,50,000/month in inefficiencies
**New System Benefits:** ₹7,00,000/month savings + ₹45,00,000/month revenue potential

## Alternative Scenarios
1. **MVP Option:** ₹6,00,000 (limited scalability, not healthcare-grade)
2. **Phased Approach:** ₹8L + ₹4L (better cash flow, delayed benefits)  
3. **Premium Implementation:** ₹18,00,000 (multi-region, future-proofed)

## Funding Strategy
- **Immediate Allocation:** ₹3,50,000 for Month 1 setup
- **Monthly Commitment:** ₹1,50,000-2,00,000 for Months 2-6
- **Contingency Buffer:** ₹2,00,000 (16% of total)

## Revised Strategy (Bootstrapped Constraints)
**DECISION: DEFER UNTIL REVENUE SCALE ACHIEVED**

Given ₹5-8L/month total budget constraints, this investment is not viable during bootstrapped phase. Recommend:

1. **Immediate Focus:** Website, mobile app, internal caregiver app development using current multi-LLM system
2. **Revenue Generation:** Client onboarding and service delivery with existing infrastructure
3. **Scale Trigger:** Consider LangGraph migration once achieving ₹25-30L monthly revenue
4. **Lean Alternative:** Use current Claude/Gemini/Jules coordination for product development

**Next Review:** When monthly revenue exceeds ₹20L and operational budget allows ₹12L+ investment
