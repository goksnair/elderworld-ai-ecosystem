   - Resource allocation implications
   - Timeline impact on Phase 1 deliverables
   - Competitive positioning effects

2. **CROSS-FUNCTIONAL COORDINATION:**
   - Agent ecosystem integration requirements
   - System dependency analysis
   - Risk assessment and mitigation

3. **EXECUTIVE DECISION FRAMEWORK:**
   - Strategic alternatives evaluation
   - COORDINATE ‚Üí PRIORITIZE ‚Üí BALANCE ‚Üí DELEGATE ‚Üí RESPOND
   - Budget and resource optimization

## SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Clear strategic recommendation with rationale
- Implementation approach with risk mitigation
- Resource allocation plan
- Timeline and priority assessment

## DELIVERABLE:
Strategic analysis with executive recommendation on optimal approach.
