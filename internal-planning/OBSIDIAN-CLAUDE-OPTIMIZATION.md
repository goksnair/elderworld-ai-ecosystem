## 🔄 Context Optimization Strategy

### **Hierarchical Context Management:**

```
obsidian-vault/Context-Management/
├── core-context.md (Always loaded - <2000 tokens)
├── phase-specific-context.md (Current phase only) 
├── agent-specific-contexts/
│   ├── senior-care-boss-context.md
│   ├── ai-ml-specialist-context.md
│   └── [other-agents]-context.md
└── session-memory/
    ├── decisions-log.md
    └── implementation-history.md
```

### **Smart Context Loading Rules:**
- **Emergency Response Tasks**: Load compliance + tech architecture context
- **Family Dashboard Work**: Load mobile product + UX context  
- **Bangalore Pilot**: Load operations + partnership context
- **AI Development**: Load ML models + healthcare ethics context

## 📊 Real-Time Agent Coordination Dashboard

### **Live Agent Status (Dataview):**
```javascript
```dataview
TABLE 
  agent_type as "Agent",
  status as "Status", 
  current_task as "Current Task",
  last_update as "Last Update",
  blockers as "Blockers"
FROM "Agents"
WHERE status = "active"
SORT last_update DESC
```

### **Phase Progress Tracking:**
```javascript
```dataview
TABLE 
  deliverable as "Deliverable",
  assigned_agent as "Agent", 
  progress as "Progress",
  deadline as "Deadline"
FROM "Operations"
WHERE phase = "Phase 1" AND status != "completed"
SORT deadline ASC
```

---

## 🔗 Cross-Session Memory Persistence

### **Session Handoff Protocol:**

**Template: Session-Handoff-{{date}}.md**
```markdown
# Session Handoff - {{timestamp}}

## Previous Session Summary
- **Primary Agent**: {{agent_name}}
- **Tasks Completed**: {{completed_tasks}}
- **Key Decisions**: {{decisions_made}}
- **Identified Blockers**: {{blockers}}

## Current System State
- **Emergency Response**: {{emergency_system_status}}
- **Family Dashboard**: {{dashboard_status}}
- **Bangalore Pilot**: {{pilot_status}}
- **AI Models**: {{ai_model_status}}

## Next Session Priorities
1. {{priority_1}}
2. {{priority_2}} 
3. {{priority_3}}

## Required Context Files
- {{context_file_1}}
- {{context_file_2}}
```

### **Agent Memory Banks:**

Each agent maintains persistent knowledge:
```markdown
# {{agent_name}} - Memory Bank

## Recent Learnings (Last 7 Days)
```dataview
TABLE 
  learning as "What I Learned",
  context as "When/Where", 
  application as "How to Apply"
FROM "{{agent_name}}/Learnings"
WHERE date > date(today) - dur(7 days)
SORT date DESC
```

## Decision History
```dataview
TABLE 
  decision as "Decision",
  rationale as "Why",
  outcome as "Result"
FROM "{{agent_name}}/Decisions"
SORT date DESC
```
```

## 🤖 Multi-LLM Coordination Enhancement

### **Enhanced Gemini + Claude Coordination:**

**Gemini Analysis Tasks:**
```bash
# Large context analysis (1M tokens)
gemini --allowed-mcp-server-names filesystem,memory-keeper,obsidian-mcp -p "Analyze complete codebase and generate strategic recommendations for {{specific_area}}"

# Meta-prompt generation
gemini --allowed-mcp-server-names filesystem -p "Read CLAUDE.md and generate optimized meta-prompt for Claude Code to implement {{task}}"

# Market research synthesis  
gemini --allowed-mcp-server-names obsidian-mcp -p "Synthesize all competitive intelligence and generate strategic positioning recommendations"
```

**Claude Implementation Tasks:**
```bash
# Use enhanced meta-prompts from Gemini
# Implement with full technical tool suite
# Update Obsidian with results and learnings
```

### **Shared Memory Coordination:**
```bash
# Both LLMs can save decisions
gemini --allowed-mcp-server-names memory-keeper -p "Save strategic decision: {{decision}}"

# Both can access persistent context
# Both can update Obsidian documentation
```

## 📈 Context Window Optimization

### **Token Usage Monitoring:**

**Context Usage Dashboard:**
```markdown
## Context Efficiency Metrics
- **Current Session**: {{token_count}}/200,000 tokens ({{percentage}}%)
- **Efficiency Score**: {{context_efficiency}}%
- **Recommended Action**: {{optimization_suggestion}}

```dataview
TABLE 
  session_id as "Session",
  tokens_used as "Tokens", 
  efficiency_score as "Efficiency",
  tasks_completed as "Output"
FROM "Context-Analytics"
WHERE date > date(today) - dur(7 days)
SORT efficiency_score DESC
```
```

### **Smart Context Chunking:**
- **Core Context (Always)**: Business model, metrics, compliance requirements
- **Phase Context (Dynamic)**: Current phase deliverables only
- **Agent Context (On-demand)**: Specific agent capabilities when needed
- **Session Context (Temporary)**: Current task-specific information
