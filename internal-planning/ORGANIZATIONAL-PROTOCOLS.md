## üß† MANDATORY CONTEXT OPTIMIZATION PROTOCOLS

### **Hierarchical Context Management (ALL AGENTS):**

**Level 1 - Core Context (Always Load):**
- Business model and revenue scale milestones revenue target
- Competitive positioning vs Emoha (‚Çπ54Cr), KITES (‚Çπ65Cr funding), Primus ($20M funding)
- Current phase objectives and constraints
- Agent-specific core competencies and success metrics

**Level 2 - Phase Context (Dynamic Loading):**
- **Phase 1**: Bangalore pilot, 100 families, <5min emergency response, >95% SLA
- **Phase 2 (Future)**: Delhi NCR expansion, 1000 families, multi-city operations
- **Phase 3 (Future)**: Mumbai/Chennai/Hyderabad, national scaling

**Level 3 - Agent Context (On-Demand):**
- Specific agent capabilities and tool access
- Inter-agent coordination requirements
- Agent-specific compliance and quality standards

**Level 4 - Session Context (Temporary):**
- Current task objectives and success criteria
- Task-specific documentation and previous decisions
- Immediate implementation requirements

### **Smart Context Chunking Rules (TASK-TYPE BASED):**

**Emergency Response Development:**
- Load: Compliance + tech architecture + hospital partnerships context
- Focus: <5 minute response protocols, Karnataka Emergency Services integration
- Agents: ai-ml-specialist, operations-excellence, compliance-quality

**Family Dashboard Development:**
- Load: NRI optimization + mobile UX + communication guidelines context
- Focus: Family-first design, timezone/currency support, senior accessibility
- Agents: product-innovation, ai-ml-specialist, market-intelligence

**Bangalore Pilot Operations:**
- Load: Operations + partnership + local compliance context
- Focus: Apollo/Manipal/Fortis integration, caregiver training, family onboarding
- Agents: operations-excellence, partnership-development, compliance-quality

**Financial Planning & Fundraising:**
- Load: Unit economics + competitive analysis + market opportunity context
- Focus: revenue scale milestones revenue pathway, Series A preparation, LTV:CAC optimization
- Agents: finance-strategy, market-intelligence, senior-care-boss

**AI Model Development:**
- Load: Healthcare ethics + predictive accuracy + family communication context
- Focus: 97.3% accuracy target, explainable AI, IoT sensor integration
- Agents: ai-ml-specialist, compliance-quality, product-innovation

## üìã CROSS-SESSION MEMORY MANAGEMENT

### **Mandatory Memory Actions (ALL AGENTS):**

**Session Start Protocol:**
1. **ALWAYS** check previous session handoff documents in obsidian-vault/
2. **ALWAYS** review agent-specific memory bank for recent learnings
3. **ALWAYS** load relevant persistent context from memory-keeper
4. **NEVER** start from scratch without referencing previous work

**During Session Protocol:**
1. **CONTINUOUSLY** document key decisions and learnings
2. **IMMEDIATELY** save strategic decisions to memory-keeper
3. **REGULARLY** update progress in obsidian-vault appropriate folders
4. **MAINTAIN** awareness of cross-agent coordination requirements

**Session End Protocol:**
1. **ALWAYS** create session handoff document for next session
2. **ALWAYS** update agent memory bank with session learnings
3. **ALWAYS** save implementation progress to persistent storage
4. **ALWAYS** notify senior-care-boss of completion status

### **Obsidian Vault Integration:**

**Required Documentation Locations:**
- `/Agents/{{agent_name}}/` - Agent-specific memory and decision history
- `/Operations/` - Operational procedures and performance metrics
- `/Technical-Docs/` - Implementation guides and architecture decisions
- `/Compliance/` - Healthcare compliance and quality standards
- `/Strategy/` - Strategic decisions and competitive analysis

**Memory Persistence Requirements:**
- Decision rationale and business impact
- Implementation details and technical specifications
- Performance metrics and success measurements
- Cross-agent coordination and dependencies
- Compliance verification and audit trails
