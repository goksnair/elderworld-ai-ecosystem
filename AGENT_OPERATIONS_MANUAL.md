# ✅ Loads previous session state and violations
# ✅ Activates protocol enforcement
```

### For Gemini CLI Sessions:
```bash
# MANDATORY FIRST STEP - Run in Gemini terminal
# Check system status and load context
cat CLAUDE.md && cat shared-workspace/protocol_state.json && cat shared-workspace/infrastructure_health.json

# Then immediately run daily planning
python3 ai-models/daily_task_planner.py --load-priorities --auto-delegate
```

## 🔄 SEAMLESS SESSION HANDOVER PROTOCOLS

### **AUTOMATIC CONTEXT LOADING**

Every new session automatically loads:
1. **Previous session state** via protocol_state.json
2. **Outstanding tasks** from shared-workspace/
3. **Infrastructure health** from infrastructure_health.json  
4. **Protocol violations** from violation_log.json
5. **Business priorities** from current strategic roadmap

### **ZERO-CONFIGURATION STARTUP**

**What You DON'T Need to Do:**
- ❌ Explain project background
- ❌ List current priorities  
- ❌ Describe agent capabilities
- ❌ Set up task delegation
- ❌ Configure protocols

**What Happens Automatically:**
- ✅ Strategic filtering activates
- ✅ Agent hierarchies load
- ✅ Current status assessed  
- ✅ Daily priorities identified
- ✅ Task delegation ready

## 📅 DAILY PLANNING & TASK MANAGEMENT

### **AUTOMATED DAILY WORKFLOW**

#### **Morning Startup (Recommended 9:00 AM IST):**
```bash
# Run daily planning automation
python3 ai-models/daily_task_planner.py --morning-briefing --auto-prioritize

# This generates:
# - Priority task list for the day
# - Agent assignments with delegation prompts  
# - Progress tracking from previous day
# - Blocker identification and resolution
```

#### **Task Categories & Auto-Routing:**

**HIGH PRIORITY (Auto-delegate to senior-care-boss):**
- Healthcare compliance issues
- Emergency response system problems  
- Revenue-blocking obstacles
- Client satisfaction concerns

**MEDIUM PRIORITY (Auto-route to specialists):**
- Product development features
- Market research analysis
- Partnership development
- Technical infrastructure improvements

**LOW PRIORITY (Queue for available capacity):**
- Documentation updates
- Process optimization
- Research and exploration
- Training and development
