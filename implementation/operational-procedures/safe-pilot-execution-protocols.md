2. DISPATCH ACTIVATION (30-60 seconds)
   - Nearest available caregiver automatic dispatch
   - Hospital emergency department notification
   - Ambulance coordination (if required)
   - Family communication across all channels

3. ON-SITE RESPONSE (1-5 minutes)
   - Caregiver arrival and situation assessment
   - Medical stabilization and safety protocols
   - Continuous family communication updates

**REAL-TIME SERVICE QUALITY TRACKING:**
```python
def quality_monitoring_system():
    # Daily Quality Metrics
    emergency_response_times = track_response_sla()
    family_satisfaction_scores = collect_daily_feedback()
    caregiver_performance_metrics = monitor_service_delivery()
    technology_platform_performance = check_system_reliability()
    
    # Automatic Quality Interventions
    if emergency_response_times > 300:  # 5 minutes
        trigger_immediate_review()
        notify_management_team()
        initiate_backup_protocols()
    
    if family_satisfaction_scores < 4.0:
        schedule_family_consultation()
