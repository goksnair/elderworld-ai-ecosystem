# Backend Development Plan

**Author:** Chief Orchestrator (Gemini)
**Agent:** tech-architecture-chief
**Status:** In Progress

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the plan for developing the backend for the emergency response system. The backend will be responsible for monitoring the health of our senior clients, detecting emergencies, and notifying the appropriate parties.

## 2. Architecture

The backend will be built on a microservices architecture. The following microservices will be created:

*   **Health Monitoring Service:** This service will be responsible for ingesting real-time data from IoT sensors and storing it in a time-series database.
*   **Emergency Detection Service:** This service will use machine learning models to detect emergencies in the incoming data streams.
*   **Notification Service:** This service will be responsible for sending notifications to family members, caregivers, and emergency services.
*   **Caregiver Dispatch Service:** This service will be responsible for dispatching caregivers to the scene of an emergency.

## 3. Technology Stack

*   **Backend:** Node.js with Express
*   **Database:** Supabase PostgreSQL
*   **Real-time:** WebSocket
*   **Message Queue:** Redis

## 4. Timeline

The backend will be developed in the following phases:

*   **Phase 1:** Health Monitoring Service (1 week)
*   **Phase 2:** Emergency Detection Service (2 weeks)
*   **Phase 3:** Notification Service (1 week)
*   **Phase 4:** Caregiver Dispatch Service (1 week)

## 5. Next Steps

The next step is to begin development of the Health Monitoring Service.
