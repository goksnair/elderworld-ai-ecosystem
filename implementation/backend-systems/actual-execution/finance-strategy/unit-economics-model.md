## 1. Overview

This document outlines the plan for the unit economics model. The goal of this model is to provide a clear understanding of the profitability of our business on a per-unit basis. This will help us to make informed decisions about pricing, customer acquisition, and resource allocation.

## 2. Key Metrics

The unit economics model will track the following key metrics:

*   **Customer Lifetime Value (LTV):** The total revenue that we expect to generate from a single customer over the lifetime of their relationship with us.
*   **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):** The total cost of acquiring a new customer.
*   **LTV:CAC Ratio:** The ratio of LTV to CAC. This is a key indicator of the profitability of our customer acquisition efforts.
*   **Payback Period:** The time it takes to recover the cost of acquiring a new customer.

## 3. Model Inputs

The unit economics model will use the following inputs:

*   **Average Revenue Per User (ARPU):** The average revenue that we generate from a single customer in a given period.
*   **Gross Margin:** The percentage of revenue that is left after deducting the cost of goods sold.
*   **Churn Rate:** The percentage of customers who cancel their subscriptions in a given period.
*   **Discount Rate:** The rate at which we discount future cash flows to their present value.

## 4. Model Outputs

The unit economics model will generate the following outputs:

*   A detailed breakdown of LTV and CAC for each customer segment.
*   A cohort analysis that shows how LTV and CAC evolve over time.
*   A sensitivity analysis that shows how LTV and CAC are affected by changes in the model inputs.

## 5. Next Steps

The next step is to gather the data that is needed to populate the model.
