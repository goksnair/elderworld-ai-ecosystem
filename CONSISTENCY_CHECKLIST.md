# Consistency Checklist

This document verifies the consistency of the ElderWorld project files after the cleanup operation.

-   [x] **Brand Identity:** All files in the current implementation directories (`current-strategy`, `customer-facing`, `implementation`, `internal-planning`) consistently use the "ElderWorld" brand name. "ElderBridge" and "Kutumb" are confined to the `research-archive`.
-   [x] **Positioning:** Customer-facing documents, such as `customer-facing/README.md` and `customer-facing/brand-guidelines.md`, reflect the "Your Best Years, Now" positioning.
-   [x] **Mission Tone:** Core documents like `current-strategy/CLAUDE.md` and `customer-facing/messaging-framework.md` have been updated to reflect the conversational, human-first mission, and corporate jargon has been removed from external messaging.
-   [x] **Research Preservation:** All identified research files have been successfully moved to the `research-archive` directory and are no longer in the root. The `DECISION_STORY_TRAIL.md` and `RESEARCH_ARCHIVE_INDEX.md` provide context.
-   [x] **Messaging Clarity:** A clear separation now exists between internal and external documents. Business metrics are confined to `internal-planning`, while `customer-facing` documents focus on the brand mission and values.
-   [x] **Multi-LLM Consistency:** All core agent protocol documents (`current-strategy/CLAUDE.md`, `internal-planning/agent-coordination-protocols.md`) are aligned with the final strategic direction, ensuring consistent operations for all agents.
-   [x] **Directory Structure:** The project now follows the clean, organized directory structure outlined in the cleanup prompt.
