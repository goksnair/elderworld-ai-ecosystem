const familyTimezones = {
  'elder': 'Asia/Kolkata',
  'daughter_canada': 'America/Toronto',
  'son_usa': 'America/New_York',
  'caregiver': 'Asia/Kolkata'
};

// Smart Notification Scheduling
function scheduleNotification(message, urgency) {
  if (urgency === 'emergency') {
    // Send immediately regardless of timezone
    sendToAllFamily(message);
  } else {
    // Schedule for appropriate times in each timezone

  encryptPHI: (personalHealthInfo) => {
    return encrypt(personalHealthInfo, {
      algorithm: 'AES-256-GCM',
      keyDerivation: 'PBKDF2',
      iterations: 100000
    });
  },
  
  auditLog: (action, user, data) => {
    logAuditEvent({
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
      action: action,
      userId: user.id,
      dataAccessed: hashData(data),
      ipAddress: user.ipAddress,
      sessionId: user.sessionId
    });
  }
};

// Access Control Matrix
const accessControl = {
  'family_member': ['read_health_summary', 'receive_notifications'],
  'primary_caregiver': ['read_detailed_health', 'update_care_notes'],
  'doctor': ['read_all_health_data', 'update_medical_records'],

    const startTime = Date.now();
    
    // Immediate Actions (0-30 seconds)
    await Promise.all([
      this.notifyEmergencyServices('108_Karnataka'),
      this.alertFamilyMembers(elderId, 'EMERGENCY'),
      this.contactPrimaryDoctor(elderId),
      this.dispatchNearestCaregiver(elderId)
    ]);
    
    // Healthcare Integration (30-180 seconds)
    const nearestHospital = await this.findNearestHospital(elderId);
    await this.reserveEmergencyBed(nearestHospital.id);
    await this.shareHealthHistory(nearestHospital.id, elderId);
    
    // Family Coordination (180-300 seconds)
    await this.establishFamilyConference(elderId);
    await this.updateEmergencyDashboard(elderId, 'IN_PROGRESS');
    
    const responseTime = Date.now() - startTime;
    this.logEmergencyResponse(elderId, responseTime);
