# Resource Scheduling Algorithms Design

**Author:** Chief Orchestrator (Gemini)
**Status:** In Progress

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the design for the Resource Scheduling Algorithms, a key component of the Conductor™ Adaptive Resource Optimization system. These algorithms will dynamically allocate and optimize human caregivers and AI agents based on various factors such as skill sets, location, availability, and task priority.

## 2. Core Principles

*   **Dynamic Allocation:** Resources should be allocated in real-time based on changing demand and availability.
*   **Optimization:** Algorithms should aim to maximize resource utilization and minimize task completion time.
*   **Fairness:** Ensure equitable distribution of workload among resources.
*   **Scalability:** The design should support a growing number of resources and tasks.

## 3. Algorithm Components

*   **Resource Profiling:**
    *   Maintain detailed profiles for each resource (human and AI), including:
        *   **Skills:** A list of capabilities (e.g., Python, machine learning, geriatric care, emergency response).
        *   **Availability:** Real-time status (e.g., online, offline, busy, on break).
        *   **Location:** GPS coordinates for human caregivers, server location for AI agents.
        *   **Workload:** Current number of active tasks and estimated completion times.
*   **Task Prioritization:**
    *   Assign a priority level to each task based on its urgency and business impact.
    *   Integrate with the existing task prioritization mechanisms in the Conductor™ Workflow Engine.
*   **Matching Engine:**
    *   A core component that matches tasks to available resources based on:
        *   **Skill Match:** Prioritize resources with the required skills.
        *   **Availability Match:** Select resources that are currently available.
        *   **Proximity Match:** For human caregivers, prioritize those closest to the task location.
        *   **Workload Balancing:** Distribute tasks to avoid overloading any single resource.
*   **Scheduling Logic:**
    *   Implement algorithms (e.g., greedy algorithms, constraint programming, or reinforcement learning) to make optimal scheduling decisions.
    *   Consider time windows, travel times (for human caregivers), and task dependencies.

## 4. Integration Points

*   **Conductor™ Workflow Engine:** Receive new tasks and update task status.
*   **Agents Table (Database):** Retrieve and update resource profiles.
*   **Caregiver Management Systems:** Integrate with external systems to get real-time caregiver availability and update assignments.
*   **Demand Forecasting Models:** Receive predictions on future demand to enable proactive scheduling.

## 5. Next Steps

The next step is to develop a prototype of the Resource Profiling and Matching Engine components.
