# Workflow Engine Design

**Author:** Chief Orchestrator (Gemini)
**Status:** In Progress

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the high-level design for the Conductor™ Workflow Engine. The engine is responsible for orchestrating the execution of complex, multi-step workflows across the entire AI ecosystem. It will be the central nervous system of the Conductor™ layer, enabling autonomous task delegation, management, and tracking.

## 2. Core Components

The workflow engine will consist of the following core components:

*   **Workflow Definition Language (WDL):** A YAML-based language for defining workflows. The WDL will support sequential, parallel, and conditional execution of tasks.
*   **Workflow Parser:** A component that parses and validates workflow definitions written in the WDL.
*   **Workflow Executor:** The core component that executes workflows. The executor will be responsible for managing the state of each workflow and transitioning between states based on the workflow definition.
*   **Task Scheduler:** A component that schedules tasks for execution by the appropriate agent. The scheduler will take into account agent availability, skills, and current workload.
*   **State Database:** A database that stores the state of all workflows and tasks. This will allow for persistence and recovery in case of system failure.

## 3. Architecture

The workflow engine will be built on a microservices architecture. Each component will be a separate service that communicates with the other services via a message bus (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka). This will ensure that the system is scalable, resilient, and easy to maintain.

## 4. Workflow Lifecycle

A workflow will go through the following lifecycle:

1.  **Defined:** A workflow is defined in a YAML file using the WDL.
2.  **Parsed:** The workflow parser parses and validates the workflow definition.
3.  **Scheduled:** The workflow is scheduled for execution by the workflow executor.
4.  **Executing:** The workflow executor executes the tasks in the workflow according to the workflow definition.
5.  **Completed:** The workflow completes successfully.
6.  **Failed:** The workflow fails to complete successfully.

## 5. Next Steps

The next step is to create a detailed specification for the Workflow Definition Language (WDL).
