## 1. Purpose of Operational Reporting & Analytics

Operational reporting and analytics are vital for:

*   **Data-Driven Decision Making:** Providing insights to optimize processes and resource allocation.
*   **Performance Monitoring:** Tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) against strategic goals.
*   **Compliance & Audit:** Ensuring adherence to regulatory requirements and internal standards.
*   **Continuous Improvement:** Identifying areas for process refinement and innovation.
*   **Stakeholder Communication:** Presenting clear and concise information to management, caregivers, and families.

## 2. Key Metrics & Reporting Areas

Reports and analytics will cover various aspects of operations, including:

*   **2.1. Task Management Metrics:**
    *   Task completion rates (overall, per agent, per caregiver).
    *   Average task completion time.
    *   Number of blocked tasks and resolution time.
    *   Task backlog and throughput.

*   **2.2. Resource Utilization Metrics:**
    *   Caregiver workload and capacity utilization.
    *   AI agent processing load and response times.
    *   Resource allocation efficiency.

*   **2.3. Care Quality Indicators:**
    *   Alert response times (from detection to resolution).
    *   Deviation resolution rates (from Aura™ insights).
    *   Care plan adherence.
    *   Patient/Family satisfaction scores (where applicable).

*   **2.4. System Health & Performance:**
    *   System uptime and availability.
    *   Error rates and system stability.
    *   API call success rates and latency.

*   **2.5. Compliance & Audit Trails:**
    *   Logs of all critical actions and decisions.
    *   Adherence to SOPs and regulatory guidelines.
