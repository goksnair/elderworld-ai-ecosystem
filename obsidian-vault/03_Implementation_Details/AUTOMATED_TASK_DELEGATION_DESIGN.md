# Automated Task Delegation & Workflow Management Design

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Draft
**Owner:** Chief Orchestrator (Gemini)
**Objective:** To design the core components and processes for automated task delegation and workflow management within the Conductor™ layer, enabling efficient orchestration of AI agents and human caregivers.

---

## 1. Purpose of Automated Task Delegation

Automated task delegation is a cornerstone of the Conductor™ framework, aiming to:

*   **Increase Operational Efficiency:** Reduce manual overhead in assigning and tracking tasks.
*   **Ensure Timely Execution:** Automatically trigger tasks based on events or schedules.
*   **Optimize Resource Utilization:** Assign tasks to the most appropriate AI agent or human caregiver.
*   **Improve Accountability:** Provide clear tracking of task ownership and progress.
*   **Enable Scalability:** Support the management of a growing number of tasks and agents.

## 2. Key Components of the Workflow Engine

*   **2.1. Event Listener:**
    *   **Function:** Monitors various sources for triggers (e.g., Aura™ alerts, Bridge™ communication events, scheduled times, manual requests).
    *   **Integration:** A2A message bus, internal system logs, external API webhooks.

*   **2.2. Rule-Based Task Assignment Module:**
    *   **Function:** Evaluates incoming events against predefined rules to determine which task needs to be created and to whom it should be assigned.
    *   **Rules:** Based on SOPs, agent capabilities, availability, and priority.

*   **2.3. Task Queue & Prioritization:**
    *   **Function:** Manages pending tasks, prioritizing them based on urgency, dependencies, and business impact.

*   **2.4. Task Dispatcher:**
    *   **Function:** Sends the delegated task to the designated AI agent (via A2A) or human caregiver (via notification system).

*   **2.5. Progress Tracking & Reporting:**
    *   **Function:** Monitors the status of delegated tasks, receives updates, and reports on overall workflow progress.
    *   **Integration:** A2A message bus (for `PROGRESS_UPDATE`, `TASK_COMPLETED`, `BLOCKER_REPORT`), operational dashboards.

## 3. Interaction with A2A Communication Protocol

The A2A communication protocol will be central to automated task delegation:

*   **Task Delegation:** `TASK_DELEGATION` messages will be used to assign tasks to AI agents.
    *   **Payload:** Will include `objective`, `deliverables`, `context_id`, and potentially `priority`, `due_date`.
*   **Progress Updates:** AI agents will send `PROGRESS_UPDATE` messages.
*   **Completion/Blockers:** `TASK_COMPLETED` and `BLOCKER_REPORT` messages will be used to signal task status.
*   **Structured Deliverables:** `TASK_DELIVERABLES` messages will be crucial for agents to report concrete outputs.

## 4. Initial Use Cases for Automation

*   **Aura™ Anomaly Response:**
    *   **Trigger:** `Aura™ Anomaly Detected` (e.g., significant sleep deviation).
    *   **Task:** `Investigate Sleep Deviation`.
    *   **Assignment:** Human caregiver or specialized AI agent for initial data review.
*   **Bridge™ Follow-up Trigger:**
    *   **Trigger:** `Pre-Call Briefing Delivered` and `No Follow-up Call Detected` within X hours.
    *   **Task:** `Send Gentle Reminder to Family`.
    *   **Assignment:** Bridge™ AI agent.
*   **SOP Compliance Check:**
    *   **Trigger:** New SOP published or existing SOP modified.
    *   **Task:** `Validate SOP Compliance`.
    *   **Assignment:** `sop_validator.py` (delegated to Claude Code for execution).
