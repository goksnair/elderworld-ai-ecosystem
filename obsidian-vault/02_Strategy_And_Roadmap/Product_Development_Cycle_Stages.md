# Product Development Cycle Stages

This document outlines the standardized stages of our autonomous product development cycle, detailing the objectives, key activities, and primary agent responsibilities for each stage, all aligned with the **Core Entrepreneurial Framework**.

## Stage 1: Strategic Research & Concept Definition

**Objective:** To conduct comprehensive market research, define product positioning, establish brand thesis, and envision initial product features that directly address customer pain points and market opportunities.

**Key Activities:**
*   Extensive market research (competitive analysis, user needs, industry trends) with a focus on identifying revenue-generating opportunities and customer acquisition channels.
*   Identification of key features and functionalities that deliver immediate customer value and contribute to Product-Market Fit (PMF).
*   Development of compelling product positioning statements and a strong brand thesis that resonates with target customers (e.g., NRI families).
*   Initial conceptualization of product features with a clear path to monetization and user adoption.

**Primary Agent Responsibility:** Gemini Prime (leveraging deep web research and strategic analysis capabilities)

**Expected Output:** Detailed market research reports, customer-centric product concept document, prioritized feature list with business impact, and a validated brand thesis statement.

## Stage 2: Product Requirements Document (PRD) & Feature Envisioning

**Objective:** To translate validated research and concepts into a formal Product Requirements Document (PRD) and further envision detailed product features, ensuring alignment with business goals and customer needs.

**Key Activities:**
*   Drafting of the comprehensive PRD, including user stories focused on customer value, functional requirements tied to business outcomes, and non-functional requirements ensuring reliability and scalability.
*   Detailed envisioning and specification of product features with a clear understanding of their contribution to customer acquisition, engagement, and revenue.
*   Defining success metrics and KPIs for the product that directly measure business impact and PMF.

**Primary Agent Responsibility:** Gemini Prime (orchestration and documentation, ensuring business alignment), Claude Code (technical feasibility input, ensuring implementability for business value)

**Expected Output:** Approved Product Requirements Document (PRD) with clear business objectives, and detailed feature specifications linked to customer and revenue impact.

## Stage 3: Technical Design & Architecture (Business-Driven)

**Objective:** To design the technical architecture and detailed system components based on the PRD, with a primary focus on enabling rapid development of customer-facing features, ensuring scalability for user growth, and optimizing for cost-efficiency.

**Key Activities:**
*   System architecture design that prioritizes modularity and speed-to-market for new features.
*   Database schema design optimized for performance and data integrity of customer and operational data.
*   API design and specifications that facilitate seamless integration with customer touchpoints (e.g., mobile apps, web dashboards) and third-party services.
*   Selection of technologies and frameworks based on their ability to deliver business value, reduce operational overhead, and support future growth.
*   Creation of technical design documents that clearly articulate how technical choices support business objectives.

**Primary Agent Responsibility:** Claude Code (ensuring technical excellence and business enablement)

**Expected Output:** Technical Design Document (TDD) demonstrating how architecture supports business goals, API specifications for customer-facing integrations, and architectural diagrams with a focus on scalability and reliability.

## Stage 4: Development & Implementation (Customer-Value Focused)

**Objective:** To develop and implement product features as per the technical design, with an unwavering focus on delivering tangible customer value, enhancing user experience, and accelerating time-to-revenue.

**Key Activities:**
*   Coding and development of backend functionalities that directly power customer services and operational efficiency.
*   Front-end development (UI/UX implementation) prioritizing intuitive design, accessibility, and brand consistency to maximize user engagement.
*   Integration of various system components to create a seamless end-to-end customer journey.
*   Unit testing and integration testing focused on ensuring the reliability and performance of customer-facing features.

**Primary Agent Responsibility:** Claude Code (backend development, ensuring business logic implementation), GitHub Copilot (front-end development, ensuring compelling user experience and rapid iteration)

**Expected Output:** Functional code, implemented features that deliver clear customer value, and test reports validating business functionality.

## Stage 5: Testing, Verification & Refinement (Business Impact Validation)

**Objective:** To thoroughly test the developed product, verify its adherence to business requirements and customer expectations, and refine as necessary to optimize for PMF, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency.

**Key Activities:**
*   Comprehensive testing (system testing, user acceptance testing) with a strong emphasis on validating customer journeys and business use cases.
*   Bug fixing and issue resolution prioritized by their impact on customer experience and revenue.
*   Performance optimization focused on critical customer-facing pathways (e.g., emergency response time).
*   Security audits ensuring data privacy and compliance (e.g., HIPAA) to build customer trust.
*   Iterative refinement based on user feedback and business performance metrics.

**Primary Agent Responsibility:** Claude Code (technical testing, debugging, and optimization), Gemini Prime (orchestration of user acceptance testing, feedback loop management, and business impact validation)

**Expected Output:** Tested and verified product demonstrating business value, bug reports prioritized by customer impact, and performance metrics aligned with business KPIs.

## Stage 6: Deployment & Monitoring (Revenue & Reliability Focus)

**Objective:** To deploy the product to production and establish continuous monitoring, ensuring maximum uptime, optimal performance, and a clear understanding of customer usage and business metrics.

**Key Activities:**
*   Deployment to staging and production environments with minimal downtime, prioritizing continuous delivery of customer value.
*   Setting up robust monitoring and alerting systems for critical business metrics (e.g., emergency response times, user engagement, conversion rates) and system health.
*   Post-deployment verification focused on validating customer experience and business functionality in a live environment.
*   Establishing feedback channels for continuous improvement, directly linking operational data to strategic business decisions.

**Primary Agent Responsibility:** Claude Code (deployment automation, infrastructure management, ensuring system reliability), Gemini Prime (overall coordination, user updates, and continuous monitoring of business KPIs)

**Expected Output:** Deployed product with high availability, comprehensive monitoring dashboards displaying business and technical metrics, and post-deployment reports detailing initial business performance.
