# Claude Code Usage Optimization Strategies

This document synthesizes best practices and recommendations for optimizing Claude Code usage, focusing on cost efficiency, performance, and effective context window management. These strategies are crucial for maximizing the value derived from Claude Code while adhering to usage limits and cost considerations.

## 1. Token Optimization and Cost Reduction

*   **Minimize Context Window Usage:**
    *   Break down large files into smaller, single-purpose units.
    *   Maintain clean and minimal codebases.
    *   Explicitly direct Claude on which files/sections to read or ignore (e.g., using `CLAUDE.md` directives).
    *   Batch related changes and be highly specific about modifications.
*   **Manage Conversation History:**
    *   Start new chat threads for separate, unrelated tasks.
    *   Summarize long conversations (e.g., using `/compact` or manual summarization) to condense history and reduce token count.
*   **Strategic Model Selection:**
    *   Use more powerful models (e.g., Claude Opus) for complex reasoning, brainstorming, or initial planning.
    *   Switch to lighter, more cost-effective models (e.g., Claude Sonnet, Haiku) for simpler tasks, execution, or refinement.
    *   Implement intelligent model routing for API usage based on query complexity.
*   **Leverage Caching:**
    *   Utilize Claude's prompt caching for frequently used prompts or segments.
    *   Implement smart application-level caching for repeated or semantically similar queries.
*   **Batch Processing:** For high-volume, asynchronous requests, use batch APIs to process multiple requests together.
*   **Optimize Prompt Structure:** Be concise, clear, and use prompt compression techniques to reduce token count while maintaining effectiveness.

## 2. Prompt Engineering for Performance and Accuracy

*   **Clarity and Specificity:**
    *   Use clear, direct, and unambiguous language in prompts.
    *   Provide precise instructions and leverage system messages to define context, role, and expected behavior.
*   **Structured Prompting:**
    *   For complex tasks, provide clear, numbered steps.
    *   Break down large tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks and use prompt chaining.
    *   Employ XML tags (e.g., `<tags>`) to clearly delineate sections within your prompt and help Claude focus attention.
*   **Enhance Reasoning and Output Quality:**
    *   Encourage deeper reasoning with phrases like "Think step by step" or using `<thinking></thinking>` tags.
    *   Provide examples (few-shot prompting) of desired output format and content.
    *   Prefill responses using the "Assistant:" notation to steer output.
    *   Add context and motivation to instructions.
    *   Control response format by instructing what *to do* rather than what *not to do*.

## 3. Monitoring and Management

*   **Track API Usage:** Implement dashboards and alerts to continuously monitor API usage and identify cost spikes.
*   **Implement Graceful Degradation:** Design applications to handle rate limits effectively (e.g., caching previous responses).

## 4. Fine-tuning (Advanced Optimization)

*   Consider fine-tuning for highly domain-specific tasks or very consistent behavior, but be aware that it is more resource-intensive.

These strategies will be integrated into our operational protocols to ensure efficient and effective utilization of Claude Code, maximizing its contribution to our entrepreneurial goals while managing costs.
