# Web Research and Deep Analysis Integration

This document outlines how web research and deep analysis capabilities will be integrated into the autonomous multi-agent system, primarily leveraged by Gemini, to ensure informed decision-making and comprehensive task execution.

## 1. Purpose and Scope

Web research and deep analysis are critical for:
*   Gathering up-to-date market intelligence.
*   Understanding emerging technologies and best practices.
*   Validating assumptions and hypotheses.
*   Informing strategic decisions and roadmap development.
*   Providing comprehensive context for complex problems.

## 2. Gemini's Role in Web Research and Analysis

Gemini, with its access to web search tools, will be the primary agent responsible for:
*   **Strategic Information Gathering:** Conducting targeted web searches to support market research, competitive analysis, and brand thesis development (Stage 1 of Product Development Cycle).
*   **Technical Feasibility Assessment:** Researching new technologies, frameworks, and solutions to inform Claude Code's technical design and architecture (Stage 3).
*   **Problem Solving & Debugging:** Utilizing web resources to research solutions for complex technical challenges or unexpected issues encountered by other agents.
*   **Compliance & Regulatory Research:** Investigating industry standards, legal requirements (e.g., HIPAA compliance), and best practices relevant to senior care.
*   **Data Synthesis & Reporting:** Synthesizing information from multiple web sources into coherent reports and insights for internal use or user updates.
*   **Continuous Learning:** Staying abreast of advancements in AI, software engineering, and the senior care industry to continuously improve agent capabilities and project outcomes.

## 3. Integration with Product Development Cycle

Web research and analysis will be integrated at various stages of the Product Development Cycle:

*   **Stage 1 (Strategic Research & Concept Definition):** Extensive use for market trends, competitor analysis, user needs, and initial feature ideation.
*   **Stage 2 (PRD & Feature Envisioning):** Researching existing solutions, user experience patterns, and potential third-party integrations.
*   **Stage 3 (Technical Design & Architecture):** Investigating technology stacks, architectural patterns, security best practices, and open-source components.
*   **Stage 4 (Development & Implementation):** Researching specific coding challenges, library usage, and debugging techniques.
*   **Stage 5 (Testing, Verification & Refinement):** Researching testing methodologies, performance benchmarks, and security vulnerabilities.

## 4. Execution Protocol

When a task requires web research or deep analysis, Gemini will:
1.  **Formulate Precise Queries:** Develop targeted search queries to retrieve relevant and accurate information.
2.  **Utilize `google_web_search` Tool:** Execute searches using the available `google_web_search` tool.
3.  **Evaluate Sources:** Critically assess the credibility and relevance of search results.
4.  **Extract & Synthesize Information:** Extract key data points, insights, and relevant context from the retrieved content.
5.  **Document Findings:** Record findings in appropriate knowledge base documents (e.g., `obsidian-vault/Market-Intelligence/`, `obsidian-vault/Technical-Docs/`).
6.  **Apply to Task:** Integrate the researched information directly into the ongoing task or provide it as context to other agents.

## 5. Reporting & Transparency

*   **Source Citation:** When information from web research significantly influences a decision or output, Gemini will cite the source (URL) where appropriate.
*   **Unverified Information:** Any information that cannot be fully verified will be labeled as `[Unverified]`, `[Inference]`, or `[Speculation]` as per the established communication protocols.
