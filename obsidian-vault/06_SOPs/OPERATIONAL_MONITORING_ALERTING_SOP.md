# SOP: Operational Monitoring & Alerting

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Draft
**Owner:** Chief Orchestrator (Gemini)
**Objective:** To define the processes and mechanisms for continuous operational monitoring of the Senior Care AI Ecosystem and for triggering timely alerts in response to deviations or critical events.

---

## 1. Purpose of Operational Monitoring & Alerting

Effective operational monitoring and alerting are critical for:

*   **Ensuring System Reliability:** Proactively identifying and addressing issues before they impact service delivery.
*   **Maintaining Service Quality:** Ensuring all AI agents and human processes perform as expected.
*   **Enabling Rapid Response:** Facilitating quick and efficient responses to critical events or deviations.
*   **Providing Transparency:** Offering real-time insights into the health and performance of the ecosystem.

## 2. Key Metrics to Monitor

Conductor™ will monitor a range of metrics across the ecosystem, including but not limited to:

*   **System Uptime & Availability:** Uptime of all core services (Aura™, Bridge™, A2A communication, databases).
*   **Task Completion Rates:** Percentage of delegated tasks completed successfully within defined SLAs.
*   **Response Times:** Latency of critical operations (e.g., AI inference, alert delivery).
*   **Deviation Alerts (from Aura™):** Notifications of significant changes in senior's wellness patterns (e.g., unusual motion, sleep disturbances, call frequency changes).
*   **Communication Channel Health:** Status of A2A messaging, external API integrations.
*   **Resource Utilization:** CPU, memory, network usage of deployed services.
*   **Error Rates:** Frequency of errors across all components.

---

## 3. Alerting Mechanisms

Alerts will be triggered and delivered through multiple channels based on severity and urgency:

*   **3.1. Internal A2A Messages:**
    *   **Type:** `ERROR_NOTIFICATION`, `BLOCKER_REPORT`, `USAGE_LIMIT_WARNING`, `API_QUOTA_EXCEEDED`.
    *   **Recipient:** Relevant AI agents (e.g., Gemini Prime, Claude Code) for automated response or awareness.

*   **3.2. Operational Dashboards:**
    *   **Mechanism:** Real-time visualization of key metrics and alert status.
    *   **Audience:** Operations team, Chief Orchestrator.

*   **3.3. Human Notifications:**
    *   **Channels:** SMS, Email, PagerDuty (for critical alerts).
    *   **Trigger:** Critical system failures, unhandled exceptions, severe deviations requiring human intervention.
    *   **Recipient:** On-call operations personnel, relevant stakeholders.

## 4. Response Protocols

Different types of alerts will have defined response protocols:

*   **4.1. Automated Responses:**
    *   **Trigger:** Minor errors, transient issues, self-correcting conditions.
    *   **Action:** Automated restarts, fallback mechanisms, logging.

*   **4.2. AI-Assisted Triage:**
    *   **Trigger:** Moderate deviations, recurring warnings.
    *   **Action:** AI agents analyze logs, suggest solutions, or escalate to human oversight with context.

*   **4.3. Human Intervention:**
    *   **Trigger:** Critical system failures, unresolvable blockers, emergency situations.
    *   **Action:** On-call team investigation, manual intervention, incident management process activation.
