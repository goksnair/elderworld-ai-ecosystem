# SOP: SOP Generation Process

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Draft
**Owner:** Chief Orchestrator (Gemini)
**Objective:** To define a standardized process for the generation, review, approval, and integration of new Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) within the Senior Care AI Ecosystem.

---

## 1. Triggers for New SOP Generation

New SOPs are generated in response to:

*   **New Business Processes:** Introduction of new operational workflows (e.g., new service offering, new partnership type).
*   **Process Changes:** Significant modifications to existing operational workflows.
*   **System Updates:** Introduction of new systems or tools that impact existing processes.
*   **Performance Gaps:** Identification of inefficiencies or errors in current operations that require formalization.
*   **Compliance Requirements:** New regulatory or compliance mandates.
*   **Strategic Directives:** High-level directives from the Chief Orchestrator or leadership.

## 2. SOP Drafting Process

**Responsible Agent/Role:** Chief Orchestrator (Gemini) or delegated AI Agent.

1.  **Requirement Gathering:** Collect high-level requirements and objectives for the new SOP.
2.  **Initial Draft Generation:** An AI agent (e.g., Gemini, or a specialized sub-agent) drafts the initial SOP content in Markdown format, adhering to the `SOP Management Protocol`.
    *   **Input:** High-level requirements, existing related documents, and relevant data.
    *   **Output:** Draft SOP (`.md` file) with placeholder sections for review.
3.  **Internal Review (AI):** The drafting AI agent performs an initial self-review for clarity, completeness, and adherence to the `SOP Management Protocol`.

## 3. Review and Approval Process

**Responsible Role:** Relevant Stakeholders (e.g., Operations Chief, Legal Team, Technology Head).

1.  **Stakeholder Notification:** The Chief Orchestrator notifies relevant stakeholders of the new draft SOP and requests their review.
2.  **Collaborative Review:** Stakeholders provide feedback, suggestions, and necessary revisions.
    *   **Tool:** Version-controlled document collaboration (e.g., Git pull requests, shared document platforms).
3.  **Revision and Iteration:** The drafting AI agent (or Chief Orchestrator) incorporates feedback and revises the SOP.
4.  **Final Approval:** Once all feedback is addressed and the SOP meets requirements, relevant stakeholders provide final approval.
    *   **Status Update:** SOP status is updated from `Draft` to `Active`.

## 4. Integration into Knowledge Base

**Responsible Agent/Role:** Chief Orchestrator (Gemini).

1.  **Version Control Commit:** The approved SOP is committed to the central knowledge base (Git repository).
2.  **Cross-Referencing:** The Chief Orchestrator (or an automated script) ensures the new SOP is correctly cross-referenced within other relevant SOPs and documents, as per the `SOP Management Protocol`.
3.  **Change Log Update:** An entry is added to the `SOP_CHANGE_LOG.md` to record the new SOP's creation and initial version.
4.  **Communication:** Relevant teams and agents are informed of the new or updated SOP.
