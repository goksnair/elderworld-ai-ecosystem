# Task: Advanced Model Ensemble Techniques for Predictive AI

## Agent: ai-ml-specialist

## Context:
Phase 2 of the AI-Driven Tech Roadmap prioritizes enhancing our predictive AI capabilities to achieve a target accuracy of >98% for health anomalies and risks. This requires moving beyond current models to more sophisticated techniques.

## Objective:
Research, evaluate, and propose advanced model ensemble techniques (e.g., deep learning, reinforcement learning, complex boosting/bagging methods) to significantly improve the prediction accuracy of our core predictive health models. The proposal should include a comparative analysis of chosen techniques, their potential benefits, computational requirements, and a high-level implementation plan.

## Key Deliverables:
1.  **Research Report:** A comprehensive report detailing various advanced model ensemble techniques, their applicability to our senior care health prediction context, and a comparative analysis of their strengths and weaknesses.
2.  **Proposed Techniques:** A recommendation of 1-2 primary ensemble techniques for implementation, justified by expected accuracy gains, computational feasibility, and alignment with healthcare compliance.
3.  **High-Level Implementation Plan:** An outline of the steps required to integrate the proposed techniques into the existing predictive health model pipeline, including data preparation, training, and deployment considerations.
4.  **Expected Accuracy Improvement:** A realistic estimate of the accuracy improvement achievable with the proposed techniques, aiming for >98%.

## Reference Documents:
*   `/Users/gokulnair/senior-care-startup/ai-ecosystem/obsidian-vault/Strategy/AI_DRIVEN_TECH_ROADMAP_PHASE_2_PROPOSAL.md`
*   `/Users/gokulnair/senior-care-startup/ai-ecosystem/ai-models/predictive-health-core.py` (for current model understanding)

## Success Criteria:
*   The research report is thorough and well-structured.
*   The proposed techniques are clearly justified and technically sound.
*   The implementation plan is actionable and considers existing infrastructure.
*   The estimated accuracy improvement aligns with the Phase 2 target.

## Next Steps (for ai-ml-specialist):
1.  Conduct in-depth research on advanced model ensemble techniques relevant to time-series health data and risk prediction.
2.  Analyze the current `predictive-health-core.py` to understand existing model limitations and integration points.
3.  Prepare the research report and proposal as per the deliverables.
4.  Notify Chief Orchestrator (Gemini) upon completion with the deliverable file path.
