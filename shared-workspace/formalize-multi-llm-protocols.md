# Task: Formalize Multi-LLM Coordination Protocols

## Agent: Claude Code CLI

## Context:
The Senior Care AI Ecosystem relies on seamless coordination between multiple LLMs (Gemini CLI, Claude Code CLI, GitHub Copilot) to achieve its strategic objectives and maintain 3x development velocity. While a strategic framework has been established, the coordination protocols need to be formalized and documented for consistent, efficient, and bulletproof operation.

## Objective:
Formalize and document the Multi-LLM coordination protocols based on existing strategic guidelines. This includes defining clear workflows, handoff procedures, communication channels, and escalation paths between Gemini CLI (Strategic Analysis Leader) and Claude Code CLI (Strategic Implementation Leader).

## Key Deliverables:
1.  **Updated Documentation:** Create or update relevant markdown files (e.g., in `obsidian-vault/01_Core_Protocols/` or a new dedicated protocol document) that clearly outline the formalized Multi-LLM coordination protocols. This documentation should be comprehensive, easy to understand, and actionable.
2.  **Workflow Diagrams (Optional but Recommended):** If feasible, include simple text-based or Mermaid.js-compatible workflow diagrams to visually represent the coordination processes.
3.  **Communication Guidelines:** Define specific guidelines for inter-LLM communication, including message types, expected response formats, and frequency.
4.  **Escalation Procedures:** Clearly define when and how tasks should be escalated between LLMs or to human oversight.

## Reference Documents:
*   `/Users/gokulnair/senior-care-startup/ai-ecosystem/CLAUDE.md` (specifically "OPTIMIZED MULTI-LLM PRODUCTION SYSTEM" and "AGENT PROTOCOLS" sections)
*   `/Users/gokulnair/senior-care-startup/ai-ecosystem/GLOBAL-SYSTEM-GUIDELINES.md` (specifically "Multi-LLM & Meta-Prompting Strategy" and "Prompt Engineering Framework" sections)
*   `/Users/gokulnair/senior-care-startup/ai-ecosystem/obsidian-vault/Session-Handoff-20250805-Multi-Agent-Production-Optimization.md` (specifically "MULTI-LLM HIERARCHY ESTABLISHED" and "OPTIMIZED PRODUCTION WORKFLOW DESIGNED" sections)

## Success Criteria:
*   The formalized protocols are clearly documented and easily understandable.
*   The documentation accurately reflects the intended coordination between Gemini and Claude.
*   The protocols address communication, task handoff, and escalation.
*   The updated documentation is placed in an appropriate and accessible location within the project.

## Next Steps (for Claude):
1.  Review the provided reference documents to fully understand the existing multi-LLM coordination framework.
2.  Draft the formalized protocols, focusing on clarity, conciseness, and actionability.
3.  Create or update the relevant documentation files with the formalized protocols.
4.  Notify Gemini upon completion, providing a summary of the changes and the file paths of the updated documentation.
