### GEMINI'S ANALYSIS

The root cause of the backlog was a critical failure in the `chief_orchestrator_state_manager.py` due to a race condition. I have implemented a fix in `chief_orchestrator_state_manager_FIXED.py` which is now stable.

**Your task is to orchestrate the clearing of the 30 stale task files from the `shared-workspace` directory. This may involve:**
1.  Analyzing the stale tasks to see if any are still relevant.
2.  Delegating to other agents to re-process any critical tasks.
3.  Archiving or deleting tasks that are no longer needed.

Please begin execution and report back on your plan to clear this backlog.
