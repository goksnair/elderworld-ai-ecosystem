# Task: Advanced Family Platform Features: Telehealth Integration Design

## Agent: product-innovation

## Context:
Phase 2 of the AI-Driven Tech Roadmap aims to enhance the family communication platform by integrating advanced features. Telehealth integration is a key sub-initiative to provide seamless remote consultations and medical advice, improving convenience and access to care for families.

## Objective:
Design the technical and user experience (UX) framework for seamlessly integrating telehealth services into the family communication platform. This design should consider user flows, API integrations with potential telehealth providers, data privacy (HIPAA compliance), and a scalable architecture.

## Key Deliverables:
1.  **Telehealth Integration Design Document:** A comprehensive document outlining:
    *   **User Flows:** Detailed user journeys for scheduling, conducting, and reviewing telehealth consultations.
    *   **Technical Architecture:** Proposed integration points, API specifications (mock or real examples), and data exchange mechanisms with external telehealth platforms.
    *   **Data Privacy & Security:** How HIPAA compliance and data security will be maintained throughout the integration.
    *   **Scalability Considerations:** Design choices that support future expansion and increased user load.
2.  **Provider Evaluation Criteria:** A set of criteria for evaluating potential third-party telehealth providers for integration.
3.  **Mock UI/UX Wireframes (Optional but Recommended):** Simple wireframes or sketches illustrating the proposed user interface within the family dashboard for telehealth features.

## Reference Documents:
*   `/Users/gokulnair/senior-care-startup/ai-ecosystem/obsidian-vault/Strategy/AI_DRIVEN_TECH_ROADMAP_PHASE_2_PROPOSAL.md`
*   `/Users/gokulnair/senior-care-startup/ai-ecosystem/actual-execution/family-communication-platform/` (for existing platform structure)
*   `/Users/gokulnair/senior-care-startup/ai-ecosystem/medical-ethics-compliance.py` (for compliance guidelines)

## Success Criteria:
*   The design document is clear, comprehensive, and technically feasible.
*   User flows are intuitive and family-friendly.
*   Privacy and security considerations are thoroughly addressed.
*   The design supports future scalability and integration with various providers.

## Next Steps (for product-innovation):
1.  Research existing telehealth integration patterns and best practices.
2.  Analyze the current family communication platform architecture to identify optimal integration points.
3.  Draft the design document, incorporating technical, UX, and compliance aspects.
4.  Collaborate with `compliance-quality` for HIPAA review and `ai-ml-specialist` for any AI-driven telehealth enhancements.
5.  Notify Chief Orchestrator (Gemini) upon completion with the deliverable file path.
