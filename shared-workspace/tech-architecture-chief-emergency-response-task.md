   - MQTT broker for IoT device communication
   - Time-series database for health metrics storage
   - Automated anomaly detection algorithms

2. **AI-Powered Emergency Detection**
   - Integration with ai-ml-specialist predictive models
   - Real-time inference engine for emergency classification
   - Configurable alert thresholds per senior profile
   - Machine learning feedback loop for accuracy improvement

3. **Multi-Channel Family Notifications**
   - SMS gateway integration (Twilio/local providers)
   - Voice call automation for critical alerts
   - Push notifications through mobile app
   - Email alerts with detailed health reports
   - WhatsApp integration for NRI families

4. **108 Emergency Services Integration**
   - Karnataka Emergency Services API integration
   - Automated emergency service dispatch
   - GPS coordinates transmission to ambulance services
   - Hospital pre-arrival notifications

5. **GPS Tracking and Hospital Coordination**
   - Real-time location tracking for seniors
   - Geofenced safe zones with alert boundaries
   - Hospital bed availability API integration
   - Nearest hospital routing optimization

6. **Real-Time Caregiver Dispatch System**
   - Caregiver availability tracking and scheduling
   - Automated dispatch based on proximity and specialization
   - ETA calculations and family updates
   - Caregiver communication portal

## ARCHITECTURE SPECIFICATIONS
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express framework
- **Database:** Supabase PostgreSQL with real-time subscriptions
- **Real-time:** WebSocket connections for live updates
- **Message Queue:** Redis for task processing
- **Monitoring:** Health check endpoints, logging, metrics
- **Security:** HIPAA-compliant data handling, encryption at rest/transit

## SUCCESS METRICS (MUST ACHIEVE)
- **Response Time:** <5 minutes from alert to family notification
- **Detection Accuracy:** >95% emergency detection rate
- **Family Satisfaction:** >90% satisfaction with alert system
- **System Uptime:** >99.9% availability
- **False Positive Rate:** <5%

## INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS
- **Coordinate with ai-ml-specialist:** Integrate predictive health models
- **Coordinate with operations-excellence:** Align with Bangalore caregiver operations
- **Coordinate with mobile-product-head:** API endpoints for family dashboard
- **Coordinate with compliance-quality:** Ensure HIPAA compliance

## DELIVERABLES
1. Complete emergency response backend system
2. API documentation for family dashboard integration
3. IoT device integration protocols
4. Emergency services integration testing
5. Performance benchmarking reports
6. HIPAA compliance documentation

## EXECUTION PROTOCOL
- Use production-ready code only (NO prototypes)
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Create automated tests for all critical paths
- Document all APIs and integration points
- Coordinate with supporting agents via shared workspace

**IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:** Begin development of core emergency detection and notification system. Bangalore pilot families depend on this system being operational by August 10th.
