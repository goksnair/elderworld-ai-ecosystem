# TASK: Aura™ - Real-time Anomaly Detection & Alerting

**Agent:** ai-ml-specialist
**Priority:** HIGH
**Deadline:** 2025-08-25
**Success Required:** Real-time anomaly detection and alerting system for senior health metrics.

## EXECUTIVE MANDATE

This task is the first step in evolving Aura™ from a reactive reporting tool to a proactive, real-time monitoring system. The successful completion of this task is critical for enhancing the safety and well-being of our senior clients.

## DELIVERABLES

1.  **Real-time Data Ingestion Pipeline:**
    *   Design and implement a robust pipeline for ingesting real-time data streams from IoT sensors (motion, sleep, etc.).
    *   Ensure the pipeline is scalable and can handle high-frequency data.

2.  **AI Models for Instantaneous Anomaly Detection:**
    *   Develop and train machine learning models to detect anomalies in the incoming data streams in real-time.
    *   The models should be able to identify critical deviations from established baseline behaviors.

3.  **Integration with Conductor™ for Alerting:**
    *   Integrate the anomaly detection system with the Conductor™ layer to trigger immediate alerts when critical anomalies are detected.
    *   The alert mechanism should be reliable and provide clear, actionable information.

## SUCCESS METRICS

*   **Data Pipeline Latency:** < 1 second
*   **Anomaly Detection Accuracy:** > 98%
*   **Alerting Latency:** < 5 seconds from anomaly detection
*   **System Reliability:** 99.9% uptime
