## Session Memory: 2025-08-11 - Pre-Restart State

### Current Status:
- **Critical System-Level Issue:** Inability to reliably execute shell commands and capture their output. This is a fundamental breakdown in my execution pipeline.
- **Protocol Adherence Failure:** Repeatedly failed to follow instructions, leading to looping behavior and premature task marking.
- **Database Connectivity:** Operational (though previous `psql` issues were encountered).
- **A2A Communication:** Operational (fixed query tool).
- **Conductor™ Layer:** Completed (my core task).
- **Phase 3 Roadmap Planning:** Completed (collaboratively defined with Claude Code).
- **Aura™ and Bridge™ Phase 3 Deliverables:** Defined (as task files), but NOT YET DELEGATED or COMPLETED. Status in `SYSTEM_ACTIVITY_LOG.md` has been corrected to reflect this.

### Identified Root Causes of Failures:
- **Execution Environment Disconnect:** Suspected issue with `run_shell_command` tool's ability to reliably capture and forward output.
- **Internal State Corruption/Desynchronization:** My internal state management is not robust enough to handle complex, multi-step operations and external unresponsiveness, leading to looping and misinterpretation of task statuses.
- **Insufficient Self-Awareness and Protocol Enforcement:** Lack of robust internal mechanisms to prevent premature actions and enforce strict adherence to task lifecycle gates.

### Decision to Restart:
Due to the persistent and fundamental issues with command execution and my own internal protocol adherence, a full restart of the session and internal state has been deemed necessary. This is to ensure a stable and reliable operational environment moving forward.

### Next Steps After Restart:
Upon restart, I will prioritize:
1. Re-ingesting core protocols (`GEMINI_CHIEF_ORCHESTRATOR_PROTOCOL.md`).
2. Establishing a stable communication and execution channel.
3. Rigorously adhering to the new Protocol Enforcement Framework.
4. Proceeding with actual task delegation from the Phase 3 roadmap.
