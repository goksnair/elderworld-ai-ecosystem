# Session Memory: 2025-08-06

## Key Directives for This Session

1.  **Implement Autonomous Session Start-up:** At the beginning of each new session, Gemini will automatically review key project files (`SYSTEM_ACTIVITY_LOG.md`, the latest `session-memory-*.md`) to understand the current context and proceed with the highest priority task without requiring a user prompt.
2.  **Maintain Session Context:** Critical, multi-session tasks (e.g., roadmap modifications) must be logged in this file to ensure context is never lost between sessions.

## Active Task

*   **Task:** Orchestrate AI Ecosystem Development (Aura™, Bridge™, Conductor™).
*   **Status:**
    *   A2A Communication Protocol: Implemented and Verified.
    *   Aura™ Phase 1 Deliverable (Weekly Wellness Report): Implemented by Gemini Prime. (`aura_data_ingestion.py`, `aura_analysis.py`, `aura_report_generator.py` created).
    *   Bridge™ Phase 1 Deliverable (Pre-Call Briefings): Implemented by Gemini Prime. (`bridge_briefing_generator.py` created).
    *       *   Conductor™ Layer (SOP Management): `HOSPITAL_ONBOARDING_SOP.md`, `HOSPITAL_ONBOARDING_CHECKLIST.md`, `SOP_MANAGEMENT_PROTOCOL.md`, `SOP_CHANGE_LOG.md`, `SOP_GENERATION_PROCESS.md`, `CONDUCTOR_FRAMEWORK_OVERVIEW.md`, `OPERATIONAL_MONITORING_ALERTING_SOP.md`, `AUTOMATED_TASK_DELEGATION_DESIGN.md`, `RESOURCE_ALLOCATION_OPTIMIZATION_DESIGN.md`, `OPERATIONAL_REPORTING_ANALYTICS_DESIGN.md`, `SELF_OPTIMIZING_WORKFLOWS_DESIGN.md`, and `PREDICTIVE_OPERATIONAL_MANAGEMENT_DESIGN.md` created. Automated cross-referencing script (`update_sops.py`) and SOP validator (`sop_validator.py`) are under debug. `AI_DRIVEN_TECH_ROADMAP_PHASE_2_PROPOSAL.md` created. `CARE_ORCHESTRATION_DESIGN.md` created. `ADAPTIVE_RESOURCE_MANAGEMENT_DESIGN.md` created.

## Revised Plan: Re-establishing Orchestration

**Phase 1: Acknowledge and Reset**

1.  **Acknowledge Mistakes:** Acknowledged deviation from Orchestrator role and direct execution.
2.  **Update Session Memory:** This update reflects the new, overarching plan.

**Phase 2: Re-establish Core Delegations & Communication**

1.  **Re-delegate Aura™ and Bridge™ Implementation Verification & Integration:**
    *   **Action:** Delegate to Claude Code the review, integration, and reporting (via `TASK_DELIVERABLES`) of the Aura™ and Bridge™ Phase 1 Python scripts implemented by Gemini Prime.
    *   **Deliverables:** `aura_data_ingestion.py`, `aura_analysis.py`, `aura_report_generator.py`, `bridge_briefing_generator.py`.

2.  **Delegate `update_sops.py` and `sop_validator.py` Debugging:**
    *   **Action:** Delegate to Claude Code the debugging and completion of `update_sops.py` and `sop_validator.py` scripts.
    *   **Deliverables:** Functional `update_sops.py` and `sop_validator.py` scripts.

3.  **Monitor Delegated Tasks:** Continuously monitor for `TASK_ACCEPTED` and `TASK_COMPLETED` messages, specifically looking for the correct `TASK_DELIVERABLES` format. If `TASK_DELIVERABLES` are not received correctly, send a `BLOCKER_REPORT` and then delegate the *debugging of the A2A communication itself* to Claude.

**Phase 3: Proactive Roadmap Management (Gemini Prime's Core Role)**

1.  **Define Next Conductor™ Task:** While delegated tasks are in progress, focus on the next strategic task for the Conductor™ layer that does *not* require immediate code implementation or direct interaction with other agents.
2.  **Collaborative Roadmap Planning:** When a roadmap phase is nearing completion, proactively draft proposals and seek feedback from Claude Code via `STRATEGIC_QUERY` before finalizing.

**Next Step:** Proceed with Phase 2, Step 1: Re-delegate Aura™ and Bridge™ Implementation Verification & Integration to Claude Code.

**Next Step:** Finalize AI-Driven Tech Roadmap Phase 2. Then, delegate initial Phase 2 tasks to relevant agents.
