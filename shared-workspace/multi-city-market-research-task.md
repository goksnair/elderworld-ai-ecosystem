# Task: Multi-City Expansion: Market Research & Localization

## Agent: market-intelligence

## Context:
Phase 2 of the AI-Driven Tech Roadmap focuses on scaling the Senior Care AI Ecosystem to new metropolitan areas across India. Successful expansion requires in-depth understanding of local market needs, cultural nuances, and regulatory requirements.

## Objective:
Conduct comprehensive market research for the initial target cities (Delhi NCR, Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad) to inform the multi-city expansion strategy. The research should identify key demographic data, eldercare service gaps, competitive landscape, cultural considerations for service delivery, and initial regulatory hurdles.

## Key Deliverables:
1.  **Market Research Report (per city):** Detailed reports for each target city covering:
    *   Demographics of the elderly population.
    *   Existing eldercare services and their pricing.
    *   Identified gaps in current service offerings.
    *   Cultural sensitivities and preferences related to elder care.
    *   Initial assessment of local regulatory environment (e.g., licensing, healthcare standards).
2.  **Localization Recommendations:** Specific recommendations for adapting our service offerings, communication strategies, and operational models to each city's unique context.
3.  **Competitive Analysis Update:** An updated competitive analysis focusing on local players in each target city.
