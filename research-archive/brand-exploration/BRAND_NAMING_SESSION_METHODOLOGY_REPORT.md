**Learning:** Emotional abstraction without logical business connection failed to resonate.

### Phase 3: Creative Framework Testing (Minutes 40-80)

**Approach:** Phonetic appeal and memorability focus
**Examples:** Names prioritizing sound over meaning
**Result:** Rejected - "Nah! move to the next approach."

**Approach:** Contrarian naming (opposite of expected)
**Examples:** Non-obvious eldercare terminology
**Result:** Rejected - "Nope! Next"

#### Framework 3C: Child's Perspective
**Approach:** Simple, innocent naming approach
**Examples:** Playful, simple terms for serious services
**Result:** Rejected - "Lets think more!"

#### Framework 3D: Reverse Engineering Success
**Approach:** Analyzing successful brand names for pattern replication
**Examples:** Tesla-inspired naming for deep tech relevance
**Initial Result:** Promising direction but execution issues

**Client Breakthrough Feedback:**
"Tesla is a deep tech engineering company, it makes sense to take inspiration from an inventor and scientist. But in that case while we need to look into similar inspirations around Senior Care theme; we should not take it literally."

### Phase 5: Business Logic Integration (Minutes 100-115)
**Breakthrough Moment:** Client articulated core naming principle

**Key Client Insight:**
"A tesla in the category of deep tech, a Uber in the category of cabs at your service, luxury of having it etc makes sense, or travel in luxury etc. There is a reason behind these inspirations if we dig deeper. there is always a connection. we are missing that connection while thinking of these names."

**Framework Shift:** From creative naming to strategic logical connection
**New Approach:** Identify logical bridges between inspiration and eldercare value proposition
