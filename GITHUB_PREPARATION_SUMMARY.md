# GitHub Preparation Summary

This document summarizes the readiness of the `ai-ecosystem` directory for cleanup and upload to a new GitHub repository.

## Current Status
The project cleanup and restructuring task is **COMPLETE**. The directory now reflects the final, unified "ElderWorld" brand strategy.

## Key Changes
-   **Unified Branding:** All files and code have been updated from "ElderBridge" to "ElderWorld".
-   **Clear Structure:** The directory has been reorganized into four main folders: `current-strategy`, `customer-facing`, `internal-planning`, and `research-archive`.
-   **Messaging Alignment:** A clear distinction has been made between internal-facing documents (containing technical details and business metrics) and external-facing documents (focused on the human-centric brand mission).
-   **Preserved History:** The complete research and decision-making history has been archived in the `research-archive` folder, complete with an index and a "story trail" document.

## Next Steps
1.  **Review Reports:** Review the generated reports for a complete overview of the changes:
    -   `CLEANUP_INVENTORY_REPORT.md`
    -   `CHANGES_MADE_LOG.md`
    -   `CONSISTENCY_CHECKLIST.md`
    -   `research-archive/RESEARCH_ARCHIVE_INDEX.md`
    -   `research-archive/DECISION_STORY_TRAIL.md`
2.  **Delete Cleanup Files:** The following files were used for the cleanup process and can now be deleted:
    -   `CLEANUP_SESSION_LOG.txt`
    -   `html_files_to_update.txt`
3.  **Initialize Git:** The directory is now ready to be initialized as a new Git repository.
4.  **Initial Commit:** Make an initial commit with the cleaned and restructured files.
5.  **Push to Remote:** Push the repository to the central GitHub remote.

The repository is now in a clean, organized, and consistent state, ready for multi-agent development to resume under the unified ElderWorld strategy.
