# Changes Made Log

This document logs the systematic changes made during the ElderWorld project cleanup on August 20, 2025.

## Phase 1: Strategic Inventory
- Created a complete backup of the project directory to `/tmp/elderworld-backup-20250820-1200`.
- Read and assimilated the final strategic direction from `ELDERWORLD_REVISED_MISSION_VISION.md`.
- Generated `CLEANUP_INVENTORY_REPORT.md`, categorizing all root-level markdown files.

## Phase 2: Research Archival
- Created the `research-archive` directory structure.
- Moved all files categorized as "RESEARCH" into the appropriate subdirectories of `research-archive`.
- Created `research-archive/DECISION_STORY_TRAIL.md` to document the strategic evolution.
- Created `research-archive/RESEARCH_ARCHIVE_INDEX.md` to index the archived materials.

## Phase 3: Current Strategy Implementation
- Created the new directory structure: `current-strategy`, `internal-planning`, `customer-facing`, and `implementation`.
- Moved core strategy files to `current-strategy`.
- Created a new, customer-facing `README.md` in `customer-facing` with the "Your Best Years, Now" messaging.
- Updated `current-strategy/CLAUDE.md` to remove financial targets and align with the new conversational, human-first mission.
- Created new strategic documents:
    - `customer-facing/brand-guidelines.md`
    - `customer-facing/messaging-framework.md`
    - `internal-planning/business-strategy.md`
    - `internal-planning/technical-capabilities.md`
    - `internal-planning/agent-coordination-protocols.md`

## Phase 4: Structured Cleanup
- Moved all remaining "INTERNAL" files to the `internal-planning` directory.
- Moved the `ui-components`, `operational-procedures`, and `actual-execution` directories into the `implementation` directory.

## Phase 5: Consistency Check
- Renamed `elderbridge-theme.css` to `elderworld-theme.css`.
- Performed a global search for "ElderBridge" and replaced it with "ElderWorld" in all remaining implementation files, including:
    - `elderworld-theme.css`
    - `brand-config.js`
    - `database/task_state_schema.sql`
    - `database/production_deployment_guide.md`
    - Numerous CSS, JS, and HTML files within the `implementation` directory.
- Generated final reports.
